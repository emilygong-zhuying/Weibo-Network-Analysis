# Weibo-Network-Analysis

## Goals and Objectives:
Through computational methods, I aim to model Weibo (the second largest social media platform in China) posts with a mathematical network structure to examine account interactions during the period of Shanghai Lockdown. 
Hypothesis: 
* Individual accounts tend to form small communities around more influential accounts on Weibo who provide insights into current events
* Viral posts (defined by the number of reposts) tend to have evoked more negative response than positive
